# ultrasonicRS
This project is an Ultrasonic Radar System built using Arduino. It allows for precise distance measurement and real-time object detection using ultrasonic distance sensors and servo motors.

## Features

- 360-degree coverage for object detection
- Real-time distance measurement and display
- User-friendly graphical interface for data visualization (optional)
- Calibration for accurate measurements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE (for uploading code to the Arduino)
- Python (for data visualization, if using the provided Python script)

### Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Ultrasonic distance sensors (e.g., HC-SR04)
- Servo motors
- Breadboard and jumper wires
