Arduino uses a C/C++-like language, and the code structure is similar to C/C++. 

However, it includes an Arduino library for simplified hardware control.

This code snippet controls the servo motor and measures distance using an ultrasonic sensor.

 You'll still need a computer for the graphical user interface (GUI) part, 
 
 which typically involves a language like Processing or Python for data visualization.

 Data visualization for your Arduino-based Ultrasonic Radar System can be done using various platforms and libraries.
